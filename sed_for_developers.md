# Lesson: Mastering the `sed` Command for Developers

**Duration**: 1.5 hours

---

## 1. Introduction

`sed`, short for "stream editor", is a versatile command-line tool essential for developers. It's used for editing streams of data, making it invaluable for tasks like code refactoring, log processing, and automated editing.

---

## 2. Basics of the `sed` Command

### a. Simple Text Substitution

One of the most common uses of `sed` in a developer's toolkit is code refactoring.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/oldFunction/newFunction/ source.c > modified_source.c
```

**Explanation**: This command replaces the first occurrence of the function name `oldFunction` with `newFunction` in the `source.c` file and writes the output to `modified_source.c`.

## 3. Working with Streams and Redirection

### a. Redirecting Input

Automate repetitive tasks, such as updating deprecated library names.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/deprecatedLib/newLib/ < library.c > updated_library.c
```

### b. Piping Input

Filter logs or process outputs on the fly.

**Command**:
```bash
$ cat debug.log | sed s/ERROR/CRITICAL/ > processed.log
```

### c. Global Replacement

For tasks like renaming variables throughout a codebase.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/localVar/globalVar/g module.py > refactored_module.py
```

---

## 4. Advanced `sed` Features

### a. Using Different Delimiters

Helpful when working with paths or URLs.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s@http://@https://@g config.txt > secure_config.txt
```

### b. Special Characters and Quoting

Escape characters come in handy, especially in pattern-heavy languages like regex.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/'\[\^0-9\]'/''/g data.txt > cleaned_data.txt
```

### c. Environment Variables and Double Quotes

Embed system variables in automated scripts.

**Command**:
```bash
$ echo "Path is: $PATH"
$ echo 'Path is: $PATH'
```

### d. Multiple Substitutions

Refactor multiple elements of your code in one go.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed -e s/"funcA"/"methodA"/g -e s/"funcB"/"methodB"/g < old_module.c > new_module.c
```

### e. Command Streams

Filter compiler or build outputs.

**Command**:
```bash
$ make 2>&1 | sed s/WARNING/INFO/
```

### f. Command Files with `-f` Option

Manage a series of `sed` refactorings across a larger project.

## 4. Developer-focused Usage Scenarios

### a. Refactoring Code

Imagine you've decided to follow a new naming convention for your functions. `sed` can help.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/funcCalculateTotal/calculateTotal/ source.c > refactored_source.c
```

**Explanation**: This renames the function `funcCalculateTotal` to `calculateTotal` throughout the `source.c` file.

### b. Removing Debug Statements

Before pushing your code, you might want to remove all debug statements.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed '/console.log/d' app.js > clean_app.js
```

**Explanation**: This removes lines containing `console.log` from the JavaScript file.

### c. Updating API Endpoints

If an API endpoint changes, you can quickly update it across your codebase.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed s/api.v1.example.com/api.v2.example.com/ config.txt > updated_config.txt
```

**Explanation**: This updates the API endpoint in the configuration file.

### d. Commenting Out Code Blocks

Say you wish to temporarily comment out a block of code.

**Command**:
```bash
$ sed '/startFunc/,/endFunc/s/^/#/' module.py > commented_module.py
```

**Explanation**: This comments out the block of code between `startFunc` and `endFunc` in a Python file.
