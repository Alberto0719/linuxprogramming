First execute python script which will generate a psedo log with 1000 entries 

python3 log_generator.py 

Output: you should have application.log

Try to examine it with cat head or tail commmands

head -n 10 application.log

Assignment #1: Log Analysis

Scenario:
After launching your new web application, users start reporting various issues. 
Some complain about performance issues, while others are encountering errors. 
To diagnose and prioritize the problems, you decide to analyze the application 
logs using different log levels.

Tasks:

INFO Analysis:

Extract all lines with the "INFO" log level from application.log.
Count the total number of "INFO" messages.
Save these messages to a file named info_logs.txt.

grep "INFO" application.log > info_logs.txt
cat info_logs.txt | wc -l

WARNING Analysis:

Extract all lines with the "WARNING" log level from application.log.
Count the total number of "WARNING" messages.
Save these messages to a file named warning_logs.txt.

grep "WARNING" application.log > warning_logs.txt
cat warning_logs.txt | wc -l

ERROR Analysis:

Extract all lines with the "ERROR" log level from application.log.
Count the total number of "ERROR" messages.
Sort the unique error messages.
Save these sorted unique messages to a file named sorted_errors.txt.
Display the first 10 unique error messages.


grep "ERROR" application.log | sort | uniq > sorted_errors.txt
head -n 10 sorted_errors.txt

DEBUG Analysis:

Extract all lines with the "DEBUG" log level from application.log.
Count the total number of "DEBUG" messages.
Save these messages to a file named debug_logs.txt.


grep "DEBUG" application.log > debug_logs.txt
cat debug_logs.txt | wc -l

Advanced Scenario:

Top 5 Recurring Errors:

Identify the five most frequently occurring error messages.
Save these frequent errors with their occurrence counts to a file named top_errors.txt.
Commands to use:

grep "ERROR" application.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5 > top_errors.txt


INFO vs. ERROR:
Compare the number of "INFO" messages with "ERROR" messages.
Which type of log message is more frequent?
Commands to use:

grep -c "INFO" application.log
grep -c "ERROR" application.log
